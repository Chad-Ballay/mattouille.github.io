        <p>Docker is a really awesome containerization platform. It dutifully simplifies LXC (Linux Containers) and enables developers to develop faster. That said, at times Docker can be a tad confusing and things can get out of hand quickly if you’re not up to speed on your docker commands. These are all commands that I keep up to date on my GitHub gists page for docker, so I use them regularly as well.</p>

        <p>Developers love consistent ways of solving repeating problems, but the most consistent problem of them all is never solved repeatedly. Every time we sit down to solve problems with software we apply design patterns to overcome situations that would be contentious if we hadn’t already solved them years ago. There’s no point in reinventing the wheel, right? So why are we sitting here planning development of software for months on end still?</p>

        <p>2017 has been really good to me and I’ve had the opportunity to grow a lot both
as as person and in my career. I’m currently writing this post sitting on my
back porch watching my dogs play.</p>

<p>That said, earlier versions of my website were always based on Wordpress. While
Wordpress is a great functional FOSS blogging platform, it was really a bit
bloated for my needs. As a developer, and someone who is trying to make more
efficient use of their time, I was looking for something that got down to the
nuts and bolts of what I wanted without sacrificing too much functionality.</p>

<p>In that I found Jekyll and GitHub pages. I kind of wrote this off as a poor
man’s solution to a common problem, however, I’ve discovered the elegance in
what Jekyll provides. Jekyll is categorized as a Static Site Generator written in
Ruby and extended through plugins and API driven services such as Disqus. You
can checkout Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I use a Mac and haven’t done a lot of Ruby focused projects so I was really
unaware of how to start. What I’ve figured out though is that between RVM and
HomeBrew you can get a sustainable environment going. I could probably also have
written a Dockerfile to do a lot of the dependency management for me, but I’m
only using one gem and that’s Jekyll itself.</p>

<p>As for deployment, I already pay for GitHub. I was a little disappointed to
discover GitHub pages doesn’t support a CDN proxy to run SSL on custom domains
but I looped in CloudFlare for that. All in all, a blog post is just a commit
away and I can use Atom as a post editor.</p>

<p>While I’ve been writing a lot of specific ‘getting started’ tutorials lately
I think it’s time that I start writing more Site Reliaibility Engineering focused
work. I currently work in an AWS environment but dumping my virtual machine
provider frees me up to do some AWS and GCP tutorials. Who knows, maybe I’ll get
froggy and do some Azure too.</p>

Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems.

        A few years ago I got out of the military as a radio technician, but before I got out I had a ominous conversation with a long time friend explaining that I thought the future of an IT career lied in a mix of systems, programming and virtualization. At the time I really knew nothing about virtualization, had really only web and some Perl/Python experience and a life long love of Linux. Since then, my experience has turned it into a beautiful well-rounded career that’s only growing.

        <p>Especially in 2017 everyone should be concerned about security. You don’t need to be a genius or completely paranoid in order to avoid most potentially compromising situations. Follow these instructions and you’ll have a basic understanding of what it is to secure your brand new, vanilla Ubuntu server. That said, if you use the web or have a publicly accessible service then there is always a chance you will be compromised. You cannot predict application patches with vulnerabilities or the colorful attempts a hacker that is specifically targeting you may employ. You may simply prep with your best effort.</p>
