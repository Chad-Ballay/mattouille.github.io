This Jekyll theme is based on the work of [renyuanz](https://github.com/renyuanz) called [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids). Unfortunately development of it has fallen to the wayside and it appears PR's are no longer accepted. I have continued that development on my blog.

This project is under MIT license, so feel free to make it your own.

## Features

* Responsive templates working on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* Simple and clear permalink structure
* Toggleable Disqus comments
* Support for single or multiple authors
* First class support for GitHub pages (no added plugins)
* OpenGraph & Twitter use site defaults for the main page or post details (include header) for pages and posts


See a [demo](https://www.mattouille.com) hosted on GitHub.

## Quick setup

* Clone this respository
* Start Jekyll as normal: `jekyll server`

## Resume Page by [@Skn0tt](https://github.com/Skn0tt)
Leonids features a simple resume page. It is divided up into five sections:

* Bio (Edit \_data/index/careers.yml)
* Education (Edit \_data/index/education.yml)
* Skills (Edit \_data/index/skills.yml)
* Projects (Edit \_data/index/projects.yml)
* About (Edit \_includes/sections/about.html)

You can put all your info into these files, and they will be featured on the resume page.
