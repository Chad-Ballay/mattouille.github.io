This Jekyll theme is based on the work of [@renyuanz](https://github.com/renyuanz) called [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids). Unfortunately development of it has fallen to the wayside and it appears PR's are no longer accepted. I have continued that development on my blog.

This project is under MIT license, so feel free to make it your own.
