I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who comes with a strong background in both
Systems Engineering and Software Engineering. I enjoy learning about new
languages, patterns, and technologies. I pride myself in holding a very
unopinionated nature, where I can work with new technologies while empowering
companies to use existing technology or dependencies to the best of their ability
while maintaining high integrity in systems engineering standards.

I started out with an emphasis in DevOps, however, have gravitated more towards
Google's model (Site Reliability Engineer, otherwise SRE). I have experience
working on SRE Platform Teams as well as App Teams.

In my spare time I enjoy indulging in home automation and have begun contributing
to more open source projects. My plan is to grow my experience in software
engineering, working with teams and eventually give talks to inspire others
to embrace the beauty that is SRE.
