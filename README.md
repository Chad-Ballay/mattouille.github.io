[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattouille/mattouille.github.io.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/mattouille/mattouille.github.io)

BlackrockDigital made the theme, it has been adjusted in this project to use a stable release of Bootstrap 4 (non-alpha). This project used to support multiple authors, however, it has since been changed to only support one. It would be fairly easy to retrofit the project for multiple authors though.

### Features

* Responsive templates working on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* Bootstrap 4 Stable
* Simple and clear permalink structure
* Toggleable Disqus comments
* First class support for GitHub pages (no added plugins)
* OpenGraph & Twitter use site defaults for the main page or post details (include header image) for pages and posts
* Google Analytics support
* Support for 23 Social Media accounts
* Atom feed generation
* Themeable syntax highlighting via SCSS
